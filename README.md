HashMap in Java has a table capacity that is always a power of 2, i.e., 
2
ùëõ
2 
n
 . This design choice is made for performance reasons, particularly to optimize the hash function and ensure an even distribution of keys across the table. Here are the main reasons why a power-of-2 capacity is used:

1. Efficient Modulo Operation:
When the capacity of the hash table is a power of 2, the modulo operation (hash % capacity) used to determine the index of an entry can be replaced with a bitwise AND operation (hash & (capacity - 1)). This is because, for any power of 2 (let's say 
2
ùëõ
2 
n
 ), the bitwise AND with 
2
ùëõ
‚àí
1
2 
n
 ‚àí1 gives the same result as the modulo operation. Bitwise operations are much faster than arithmetic operations.

Example:
If the capacity is 16 (which is 
2
4
2 
4
 ), then instead of computing hash % 16, which involves a division operation, you can compute hash & 15 (since 15 is 
16
‚àí
1
16‚àí1), which is a single bitwise AND operation.

2. Uniform Distribution:
Using a power of 2 as the capacity helps in achieving a more uniform distribution of hash values. Since hash & (capacity - 1) effectively masks out the higher-order bits and keeps the lower-order bits, it ensures that the resulting index is within the range [0, capacity - 1].

Example of Index Calculation:
java
Copy code
int capacity = 16; // 2^4
int hash = someHashFunction(key);
int index = hash & (capacity - 1);
Here, index will always be within the range [0, 15].

3. Resizing Mechanism:
When the table needs to be resized (usually when the load factor threshold is exceeded), doubling the capacity (i.e., 
2
ùëõ
2 
n
  to 
2
ùëõ
+
1
2 
n+1
 ) ensures that the hash values are still distributed evenly. This doubling strategy also means that elements that were previously indexed at i will either stay at i or move to i + oldCapacity in the new table, which makes the rehashing process efficient.

4. Simplicity in Implementation:
Using capacities that are powers of 2 simplifies the implementation of the HashMap, particularly in the calculation of indices and during resizing. This simplicity helps in reducing the chances of bugs and making the code easier to maintain.

Summary:
Efficient Calculation: Bitwise operations are faster than modulo operations.
Uniform Distribution: Ensures even distribution of hash values across the table.
Efficient Resizing: Simplifies rehashing during resize operations.
Implementation Simplicity: Makes the code cleaner and less error-prone.
Practical Example:
java
Copy code
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int capacity = 16; // 2^4
        int hash = "example".hashCode();
        int index = hash & (capacity - 1);
        
        System.out.println("Index: " + index);
    }
}
In this example, the index is calculated using the bitwise AND operation, ensuring it falls within the range [0, 15].

Conclusion:
The choice of using a table capacity that is a power of 2 in Java's HashMap is a deliberate design decision aimed at optimizing performance, ensuring even distribution of entries, and simplifying the implementation. This design leverages the efficiency of bitwise operations and the predictability of doubling the table size during resizing.
